## Detection of authentic disasters related tweets using machine learning

With the emergence of new technologies, our ability to
communicate with others has increased dramatically. No longer can
communities rely solely on buying traditional media, newspapers,
radio, and TV news. With the emergence of smartphone technology,
communities are simply an 'app' away from being able to deliver or
receive information within milliseconds.


Recently, Twitter has been used to spread updates/news all over the
world and has been effective in emergencies during natural
calamities like floods, earthquakes and wildfires. Twitter has proved
that it has the potential to increase survival of a person during a
Tornado related disaster. Communication forums allow for the
communication of various networks that you can help officials during
a disaster to make a list of victims, deceased, and contact with family
and friends of all victims during the communication and planning of
victims and respondents.


Twitter has become an invaluable tool throughout the world,
especially for spreading and discussing issues in everyday life. There
are an estimated 500 million Twitter users worldwide. But the tweet
generated is not always informative in nature. Thus there should be
some method to classify the tweet.


Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of
emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to
announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. In times of
emergencies there will be a lot of tweets being floating on twitter.
But it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually
announcing a disaster. It might be clear to a human eye right
away but less clear to a machine. We build a machine learning
model that predicts which tweets are real about disasters and
which one’s are not.
